== About Me

* independent consultant & developer

* got interested in this approach at a conference in 2002

* member of ASF and committer for Apache Isis

* (since 2004) worked on the largest naked objects system at DSP, a government department in Ireland

* (since 2012) worked on Estatio, an open source app for estate management based on Apache Isis

== Apache Isis (and naked objects)

* The Apache Isis framework is an implementation of the naked objects pattern
* Named & developed by Richard&nbsp;Pawson and Rob&nbsp;Matthews
** further details in Richard's "Naked&nbsp;Objects" PhD thesis
** external examiner was Trygve Reenskaug

== An example: Estatio

* Estatio is an invoicing application (out-bound to tenants within a shopping centre, inbound for suppliers)
* Developed for Eurocommercial Properties, deployed to the three operating countries (Italy, France & Sweden)
* The code also happens to be open source (on github)
** A useful "reference example" for the Apache Isis user community

== Hands-on Tutorial

The tutorial consists of:

* step by step instructions at http://github.com/danhaywood/isis-petclinic-docs[]

* solutions for each step at http://github.com/danhaywood/isis-petclinic-tutorial[]

Try the early exercises, to see how things fit together.

Thereafter, checkout the git tags that look interesting.



[.dan]
== Bounded contexts, standard interactions

* Each system should have clear responsibilities
** A bespoke app (as opposed to a packaged/COTS system) can be tailored precisely for its user base
* Multiple hooks (SPIs) at the application layer, domain layer, persistence layer
** In particular, interactions can be automatically published to other systems in the enterprise

=== A published action

[source,java]
----
@Action(
    invokeOn = InvokeOn.OBJECT_AND_COLLECTION,
    publishing = Publishing.ENABLED
)
public Invoice approve() {
    setStatus(InvoiceStatus.APPROVED);
    return this;
}

=== PublisherService SPI

[source,java]
----
public interface PublisherService {
    void publish(Interaction.Execution<?, ?> execution);
}

=== Cross-cutting

[.dan]
== Maintainability

DDD systems tackle complex domains, so are (by definition) substantial investments.
However:

* a good UI is expensive and difficult to get right, UI/UX skills relatively rare in most organisations
* it's difficult to maintain a consistent UI at scale
* a generated UI prevents accidental coupling

A generic UI makes for maintainable systems





[.dan]
== Concluding

Apache Isis (and the naked objects pattern) enables:

* rapid development - feedback loop to learn the domain
* testable - necessary for complex domains
* modular within the domain - avoid the "ball of mud"
* architectural constraints / separation of concerns
** intra-app (hexagonal architecture) and inter-app (BCs)
